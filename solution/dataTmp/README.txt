Numerical suffixes are the hackerranks tests (trying to be in their order)

Alphabet suffixes are my tests:

A* - testing of repeating strings turning into non-repeating strings
B* - testing simplest case repeating strings, hopefully covering all possible cases
C* - testing more complicated strings, combinations of cases
D* - testing longer strings
E* - splitting apart hackerrank tests
